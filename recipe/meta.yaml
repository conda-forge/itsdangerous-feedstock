  summary: Safely pass data to untrusted environments and back.
  description: |
    Various helpers to pass data to untrusted environments and to get it
    back safe and sound. Data is cryptographically signed to ensure that a
    token has not been tampered with.

    It's possible to customize how data is serialized. Data is compressed as
    needed. A timestamp can be added and verified automatically while
    loading a token.
